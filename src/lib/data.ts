// This file acts as a centralized module to import and export all mock/seed data
// from the /data directory. This avoids import resolution issues in client components.

// Re-exporting all the data so it can be imported from a single, reliable source.
// This file is intentionally left with no imports as all mock data has been removed.
// Components should fetch data directly from Firestore.
